Use the following technologies 

1. PHP 

2. Laravel 

3. Any front end framework such as React, vue or plain JavaScript 

3. JSON 

 

 

Requirements 

Produce a demo for interacting with an input from to pull data from the Spotify Search API. 

 

A link to the documentation is here 

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/search 

 

And for the authorization guide it is here 

https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/  

 

Any issues with authorization you should let us know ASAP. It will require a free spotify account, however if this raises any problems let us know and we can supply you with a custom developer account. 

 

The demo should consist of 2 parts. The first being a Laravel server which pulls data from Spotify, the second is the front end which displays the data. The code can be structured however you best see fit.  

 

We will not be judging you on your design skills. 

 

The final product should demonstrate 

 

1. Well structured PHP 

2. Understanding of external APIs and extracting data 

3. Understanding of code design patterns 

4. Understanding of a front end framework 

5. JSON parsing 

6. Understanding TTD 

 

Optional: 

 

The spotify search API uses a ‘type’ parameter to distinguish what type of search is being performed, as an optional task look for a way to switch between what type of search you are performing and write a test to validate that this new endpoint is working.
